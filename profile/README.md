## Who Am I? 

I am working as a full-stack software engineer with a heavy mathematics background. I enjoy working on complex problems and learning about new technologies, especially ones that involve clever computational techniques. I'm always up to working on new problems. 

Get in touch if there is anything you want to know. I'll enjoy talking about just about anything.
